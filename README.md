# electron-mongo-boilerplate
quick way to get started with electron and mongodb

Hey there,

This repo contains boilerplate code to quickly get started with an electron-mongodb project. I prefer to use [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/) in a mongodb project, that's why I've added it. However, you're free to remove or use it.

## To get started

1. Download or clone this repo
2. Make sure you have node.js and mongodb
3. cd to your project folder
4. Run this command to install all the dependencies ```npm install```
5. Make sure to run mongod.exe and your db folder is present. 
6. Run this command to startup the app ```npm start```

## Dependencies

* ```electron```
* ```mongodb```
* ```mongoose```

## Additional Notes

 * I suggest you to use [Robo3T](https://robomongo.org/) as a GUI for your mongodb. It's free, lightweight and open-source.
 * [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) is a also great tool which helps a lot in projects.
